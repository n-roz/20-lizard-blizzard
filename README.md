# Getting Started with Create React App

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[View my unsuccessful deployment here.](https://lizard-blizzard.herokuapp.com/)

I actually really liked this project! Making a portfolio can kind of be a drag but I learned a lot from this project. I must admit my portfolio is unfinished (not deployable and no styling). I am submitting this in the hope of getting some partial credit! I will be styling this to use as my portfolio for job searching.

See my ```heroku logs --tail``` below for an insight into my deployment errors.
